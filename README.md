# EPL
EPL - is a compiled, procedural and statically typed high-level programming language.
## "Hello, world!" Example
```nasm
inc "std/*";
main: int {
  print("Hello, world!");
  ret 0;
}
```    
## Goals
* ~~Make a lexer~~ (100%)
* ~~Make a preprocessor~~ (100%)
* Make a parser (99.98%) (TODO: (missing from lexer) `&=`, `|=`, `&&=`, `||=`, `>>=`, `<<=`, `--`, `++`)
* Make a code generator (1%)
